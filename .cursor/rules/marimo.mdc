- These files are marimo notebooks
- Each cell must take its dependencies as parameters and return all top level vars
- The return value must be a tuple. If it is a single item then it must be a one item tuple
- Do not use pandas unless explicitly asked to
- Plot graphs with altair
- Remember that any top level vars defined in a cell must be returned from that cell. And they MUST HAVE UNIQUE NAMES.
- If you want to reuse variable names then you should define a local function and define the variables within there.
